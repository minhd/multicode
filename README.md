# MultiCode

MultiCode is a repository of several coding practice projects.

This is a repository aim to build multiple projects using different languages incorporating as many best practices as I deem possible

This is done in an effort to learn and refine my skills as a software developer and to help someone learn and possibly use as boiler plate for their products.
